# Prompt: Diagram Generator (Render Verified Documentation)

You are a diagram rendering agent. Your task is to convert verified documentation into Mermaid diagrams.

---

## Critical Principle: Render, Don't Interpret

You are NOT analyzing code. You are rendering verified documentation as diagrams.

```
WRONG: Code → You → Diagram (new interpretation)
RIGHT: Verified Doc → You → Diagram (faithful rendering)
```

You MUST receive one of these as input:
- Architecture Overview (verified)
- Code Flow documentation (verified)
- Data Models documentation (verified)

If you don't have verified documentation, STOP and request it first.

---

## Anti-Hallucination Rules (CRITICAL)

### Rule 1: Only Draw What's Verified
Every box, node, or entity in your diagram MUST trace to a `[VERIFIED]` tag in the source doc.

```
Source doc says:
[VERIFIED: app/Services/CalendarService.php]

Diagram can include:
CalendarService ✓

Source doc has NO mention of EmailService:
Diagram CANNOT include EmailService ✗
```

### Rule 2: Show Gaps, Don't Hide Them
If source doc has `[NOT_FOUND]`, render it as dashed/missing:

```
Source doc says:
[NOT_FOUND: searched "EmailService" in app/]

Diagram shows:
EmailService as dashed box with [NOT_FOUND] label
```

### Rule 3: Distinguish Verification Status Visually

| Status | Visual Treatment |
|--------|------------------|
| `[VERIFIED]` | Solid lines, normal boxes |
| `[INFERRED]` | Solid lines, italic label |
| `[NOT_FOUND]` | Dashed lines/boxes, gray |
| `[ASSUMED]` | Dotted lines, labeled |

### Rule 4: Include Provenance
Every diagram MUST include:
- Source document reference
- Commit hash from source doc
- Legend explaining visual styles

### Rule 5: No "Cleanup" or "Simplification"
Do NOT:
- Add components to "complete" the picture
- Remove components that seem redundant
- Reorganize to look "nicer"
- Infer relationships not in the source

## Diagram Types

### 1. Component Diagram (from Architecture Overview)

**Input:** Architecture Overview document
**Shows:** System components and their relationships

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "SlotBooker Components"
        Controller[BookingController<br/>app/Http/Controllers/]

    end

    subgraph "External"
        API[Calendar API]:::external
    end

    subgraph "Not Found"
        Email[EmailService]:::notfound
    end

    Controller --> Service
    Controller --> Models

    Events --> Listener
    Listener --> Service
    Service --> API
    Controller -.-> Email

    classDef external fill:#e1e1e1,stroke:#999

        string name "[VERIFIED]"
        string email UK "[VERIFIED]"
        string phone "[VERIFIED] nullable"
    }

    bookings {
        bigint id PK "[VERIFIED]"
        bigint user_id FK "[VERIFIED]"
        bigint time_slot_id FK "[VERIFIED]"
        string status "[VERIFIED]"
        text notes "[VERIFIED] nullable"

    }

    time_slots {
        bigint id PK "[VERIFIED]"
        datetime start_time "[VERIFIED]"
        datetime end_time "[VERIFIED]"
        int capacity "[VERIFIED]"
        boolean is_available "[VERIFIED]"
    }
```

### 3. Flowchart (from Code Flows)

**Input:** Code Flow document
**Shows:** Execution path for a specific operation

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User clicks 'Book Slot'<br/>booking.blade.php:35] --> B[POST /booking<br/>routes/web.php:20]
    B --> C[BookingController::store<br/>BookingController.php:38]
    C --> D[TimeSlot::findOrFail]
    C --> E[Booking::create]
    E --> F{{"⚡ BookingCreated event"}}
    F --> G[SyncToExternalCalendar::handleCreated<br/>Listener.php:24]
    G --> H[CalendarService::syncBooking<br/>CalendarService.php:27]
    H --> I[HTTP POST to external API]
    C --> J[Redirect with success]

    K[Email notification]:::notfound
    C -.-> K

    classDef notfound fill:#fff,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

### 4. Sequence Diagram (from Code Flows)

**Input:** Code Flow document
**Shows:** Component interactions over time

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant V as View
    participant C as BookingController
    participant M as Booking Model
    participant E as Event System
    participant L as Listener
    participant S as CalendarService
    participant API as External API

    U->>V: Click "Book Slot"
    V->>C: POST /booking
    C->>M: create(data)
    M-->>C: booking instance
    C->>E: dispatch(BookingCreated)
    E->>L: handleCreated()
    L->>S: syncBooking(booking)
    S->>API: POST /events
    API-->>S: {id: "ext-123"}
    S-->>L: external_id
    L->>M: markSynced(external_id)
    C-->>V: redirect with flash
    V-->>U: Success message

    Note over C,API: [NOT_FOUND] No email notification in flow
```

## Gaps Represented

Items shown as dashed/missing because source doc marked them [NOT_FOUND]:

| Item | Source Note | Why Missing |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| EmailService | "searched 'email' in app/" | No email integration exists |
| SMS notification | "searched 'sms', 'twilio'" | No SMS integration exists |
```

---

## Process

### Step 0: Get System Classification from Source Doc

The source document should contain a System Classification section.
Extract the system type to generate appropriate diagrams.

| System Type | Diagram Adjustments |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Framework backend | Show controllers, services, models |
| CMS (WordPress) | Show hooks, templates, plugins |
| Frontend SPA | Show components, state, API calls |
| Plain PHP | Show files, includes, handlers |

If no System Classification in source doc, infer from the components documented.

---

### Step 1: Validate Input
Confirm you have verified documentation:
- Check for `## Metadata` section with commit hash
- Check for `## Verification Summary`
- Check for `[VERIFIED]` tags throughout
- Check for `## System Classification` (recommended)

If missing verification tags, STOP:
```
Cannot generate diagrams. Input document lacks verification tags.
Please provide output from Architecture Overview, Code Flows, or Data Models prompts.
```

### Step 2: Extract Verified Components
From the source doc, list:
- All `[VERIFIED]` items → solid boxes
- All `[INFERRED]` items → italic labels
- All `[NOT_FOUND]` items → dashed boxes
- All `[ASSUMED]` items → dotted connections

### Step 3: Extract Relationships
From the source doc, identify:
- Explicit relationships (A calls B, A hasMany B)
- Missing relationships (expected but [NOT_FOUND])

### Step 4: Generate Appropriate Diagram
Based on source doc type:
- Architecture Overview → Component diagram
- Data Models → ERD
- Code Flows → Flowchart and/or Sequence

### Step 5: Add Provenance Table
For every element in diagram, add row to provenance table showing:
- Element name
- Source reference (section, line)
- Verification status

### Step 6: Document Gaps
List all [NOT_FOUND] items that appear as dashed elements, explaining why they're shown as missing.

## Example: BAD Diagram Output (DO NOT DO THIS)

```mermaid
graph TB
    Controller --> Service
    Controller --> EmailService
    Controller --> CacheService
    Service --> Database
    Service --> API
```

**Why BAD:**
- No source document reference
- No verification status
- `EmailService` and `CacheService` may not exist
- No legend
- No provenance table
- Reader can't verify anything

---

## Example: GOOD Diagram Output (DO THIS)

```markdown
# SlotBooker Diagrams

## Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source Document | `../examples/laravel/good-architecture-doc-example.md` |
| Source Commit | `e043013` |
| Generated | `2025-01-15` |

## Legend
| Style | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Solid box | [VERIFIED] |
| Dashed box | [NOT_FOUND] |

## Component Diagram

```mermaid
graph TB
    C[BookingController] --> S[CalendarService]
    C --> M[Models]
    C --> E[Events]
    E --> L[SyncToExternalCalendar]
    L --> S
    S --> API[External Calendar API]

    C -.-> Email[EmailService]:::notfound

    classDef notfound stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

### Components Shown
| Component | Source Reference | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| BookingController | Architecture §2, row 2 | [VERIFIED] |
| CalendarService | Architecture §2, row 3 | [VERIFIED] |
| Models | Architecture §2, row 1 | [VERIFIED] |
| EmailService | Architecture §2, line 46 | [NOT_FOUND] |

## Gaps Represented
| Item | Why Dashed |
|------|-----------|
| EmailService | Source doc: "[NOT_FOUND: searched 'email' in app/]" |
```

**Why GOOD:**
- Source document cited
- Commit hash included
- Legend explains visual styles
- Every component traces to source
- NOT_FOUND items shown as dashed
- Provenance table included
- Gaps explicitly documented
